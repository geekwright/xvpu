<h4>Get Started</h4>
<p>
    Entering the Xvpu module will give you a chance to specify an alternate test directory if needed. Submit the initial form to launch the application. Since being inside a running XOOPS system could interfere with the creation of the proper testing environment, the testing is carried out with a freestanding application, nested inside the Xvpu module.
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
    Click on Tests section in the left hand panel to reveal the available tests. Here you can select the test(s) to run.
</p>
<h4>Options</h4>
<p>
    The following options are available.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create Snapshots</strong> - save the results of the test run so it can be reviewed later.</li>
        <li><strong>Sandbox Errors</strong> - captures PHP errors in test output</li>
    </ul>
    Also in this section of the panel is the <strong>Run Tests</strong> button which runs the selected test(s) with the chosen options.
</p>
<h4>Archive</h4>
<p>
    Archives are stored by date and time. Choose an archive (created by setting <em>create snapshots</em> when running the tests) to display the saved results. Archive files are saved in the modules/xvpu/app/history directory. At this time, these need to be manually pruned.
</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>
    The results panel will show the results of the tests. The results of each selected test will be shown, along with summaries of test statuses. Click the "+" icon to the right of test displays to expand and show detail.
</p>
<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>
    In module preferences, specify the path to the unit test directory. This will default to a location consistent with working inside a XOOPS/XoopsCore fork, and will guess at the location of the UnitTestXoops directory. If this is not correct, specify the desired default directory.
</p>
<p>
    If your system is used by others that you do not want to be able to use Xvpu, be sure to check the module permissions granted to each group. Use of Xvpu in a production environment is NOT recommended.
